# DataWrangling
This project was done for the Data Analysts Nanodegree project for Data Wrangling.

This project involved analyzing the data for the twitter account @dog_rates. This handle rates dogs and how cute they are on a scale. 

The objective was to download the twitter data for this handle. Sift through the tweet text data, collect, organize and enhance the data to create insights into the data set.
